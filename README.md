## Description

As part of this weekly challenge, we were asked to create a blog with which development enthusiasts. The functionality of the development blog includes but is not limited to:

- Log-in option for existing users
- Sign-up option for new users
- Dashboard view from which to create new posts on latest technologies

I leveraged:
 - express package to handle server set-up, routes for my application pages, and routes for blog data
 - express-session package to save sessions and specific user data

- HTML5 to organize and structure the webpage
- CSS3 to apply styles and responsiveness to the webpage

## Usage

Here you will find a link to the deployed webpage:
